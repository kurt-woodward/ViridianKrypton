## User Interface Design - Wireframe Drafts
	See uploaded jpg files. 
### Since this project is primarily a file server, the user interface is limited to a login page, a user dashboard, and a user profile page. 
## Page Descriptions:
	
### Login: There is a logo, a username text field, password entry field, and a checkbox to agree to terms and conditions.

####	User dashboard: In center page there is a field for previewing the 3d scan with sliders to rotate it. Left top has admin notifications. These could include messages about when, by which linked account, and for what purpose the scans have been accessed. Left bottom is a field for selecting which scan to preview and select options for. Right top is the dropdown menu where users can access their profile page or logout. Right mid-page and right bottom are for selecting options regarding the currently selected scan.

#### User profile: Center page are fields for entering and/or changing user personal information. Center bottom allows the user to change their account password. Page right are options pertaining to user data. Left mid-page are icons for selecting other accounts or services to which the user chooses to grant access. Clicking an icon would take the user to a login screen such as Facebook or Google use to enter that login information and link the accounts. Selecting a linked account would bring up a notification box allowing the user to change preferences for that app or unlink that account. Left bottom is a text box for displaying the app's privacy policy notice. Left top is for notifications again.
